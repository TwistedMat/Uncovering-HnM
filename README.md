## Does H&amp;M's data tell us something about them that they themselves are unaware of? 

Using H&Ms Kaggle dataset, we have analyzed their purchases over a course of 2 years and attempted to create value through the power of EDA, an often ignored aspect of Data Science. 

The EDA performed helped uncover some interesting insights about their user's purchasing behaviour, the unneeded inventory, unexplored markets and seasonal sales performances. To know more, look at the detailed notebook with our findings. 

### Note: The notebook is best viewed in Google Collab owing to interactive plots and limitation of Github.
